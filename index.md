    <h2 class="text-decoration-underline">About</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Thanoshan Vijayanandan, a Software Engineer from Sri Lanka, currently working at <a href="https://99x.io/about" target="_blank">99x</a>. My journey started from humble beginnings. With a Bachelor's degree in Computing and Information Systems, I've explored the tech world driven by my passion for Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

    <p>As a PhD aspirant, my curiosity drives me to delve into the complexities of Software Engineering and AI, aiming to contribute innovative solutions. I believe in lifelong learning to keep up with new technologies and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to exchange insights and grow together.</p>

    <p>My passion for open-source began early in my career, where I found great value in learning and growing within a global community. This drive led me to become an Apache Software Foundation Committer for <a href="https://shardingsphere.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache ShardingSphere</a>. It's not just about writing code but being part of something largerâ€”sharing knowledge and building better software together. For me, open-source is more than just work; it's a meaningful way to contribute positively to the world.</p>

    <p>I enjoy sharing my experiences and insights in technology through blogging, reflecting on my journey and engaging with a wider audience.</p>
